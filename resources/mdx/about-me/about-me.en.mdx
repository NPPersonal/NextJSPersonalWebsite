### Background

---

I am born in Taiwan and studied information technology in Queensland
University of Technology. Software development always be my interest
since I was teenager. Therefore I am studying and learning in this field
continuously.

Software development involve many elements. I have spent years self-taught
about new skills and knowledges regarding to programming languages, frameworks
and development tools. As long as a skill or knowledge can improve development
and solve problems, I am keen to learn.

For past few years I have experinced in native mobile app development
on IOS platform both in company and contact. Due to an acquirement of a peronsal
website for myself, I start to learn [React](https://react.dev/) framework.
This personal website was created from [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) which
is based on React. In addition cross-platform development
for mobile has become more popular. Thus I start to learn [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
As I mention above that software development involve many elements, for this I push
myself to gain more knowledges on different development tools such as Docker, NPM.

Recently machine learning and artificial intelligent becoming more popular and many
applications for real life. I start to learn more about this topic in this field
and studying on how to integrate it into software for real life application. For
example this is a human brain [tumor detector](https://braintumordetectorapp.streamlit.app/)
which use deep learning to scan MRI image then tell whether there is a tumor or not.

### Programming languages

---

That would be great to learn onece and for all. However it is not happening at moment.
Different frameworks or solutions might involve different programming languages.
Following are programming languages I have experienced.

- Javascript
- Python
- Objective-C
- Swift
- C#
- C++
- PHP

<br />

### Frameworks

---

Learning a new framework can expand skills and knowledges. Later they may become
an soltion for problem in development journey.

These are frameworks I have had used.

- [IOS SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_SDK): Software development kit for IOS platform
- [React.js](https://react.dev/): Open-Source framework for frontend web development
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): Based on React.js and more features completed for web development. For
  example write your own Restful API
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): Based on React.js similar to Next.js. Feature in many plug-ins
  and great for CMS website. This personal website was born from this framework
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/): Similar to React.js but for cross platform development on mobile app
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Minimal web framework based on Node.js and capable of backend. In addition
  it comes with frontend support
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): A framework for deep learning
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): A framework for deep learning and popular in research area
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): A framework for machine learning
- [Codelgniter](https://www.codeigniter.com/): A light weight framework for developing PHP website

Learning additional development tool and knowledge come in handy from time to time.
There are few tools and experiences I had.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control): Version control for source code
- [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD): Continuous integration and continuous delivery such as
  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and [TravisCI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Containerized light weight virtual machine
- [Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database): Database such as [MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and
  [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/): A packages management for IOS development
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): A packages management for javascript

<br />

### OS

---

- Windows
- MacOSX
- Linux: still learning
