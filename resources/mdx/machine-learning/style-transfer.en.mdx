### Introduction

---

Style transfer app allow you to transform a real photo into a vangogh
panting style. The result is combination of real photo with vangogh style.

<br />

### Motivation & Purpose

---

Learning a particular skill of panting style then apply it on drawing of beautiful
scene or object would be a time consuming and difficult process. Not everyone can
do it. Hand over this task to artificial intelligent can shorten this process.

This artifical intelligent learn the style of painting from vangogh and then transform
a real photo into the style.

<br />

### More

---

The model was trained with
dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suyashdamle/cyclegan?select=vangogh2photo).

The model use [CycleGAN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cyclegan) to achieve
style transfer for real photo.

The model's size had been reduced by using
[DepthwiseConv2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/DepthwiseConv2D)
instead of [Conv2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D).

Frameworks were used to build this app:

- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) : Deep learning framework for the model
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) : Frontend app

<br />

### Note

---

From time to time this app is not able to complete transfer style properly due to
dataset was limited and hardware restriction during model training.
