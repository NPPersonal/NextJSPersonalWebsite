a popular framework. As well as for me to see information for new movies

<br />

### More

---

The website use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as frontend. Instead of using frontend
framework such as [React.js](https://react.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
provide a feature **Serverless**.

**Serverless** similar to a function in programming term. It allocate resource
and be executed on demand otherwise it is in sleep. Thus there is no need to
run a server continuously.

Frameworks were used to build this website:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) : Primary framework
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) : Frontend UI framework
- [Themoviedb](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) : Movies data source
